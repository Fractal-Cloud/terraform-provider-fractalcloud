# function: observability_caas_tracing

Creates a CaaS Distributed Tracing component. If `container_platform` is provided, it is validated to ensure it is a Container Orchestrator component and added as a dependency. This ensures the tracing stack is not reconciled until the container platform is active.

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  k8s = provider::fc::network_and_compute_paas_container_platform({
    id           = "main-k8s"
    display_name = "Main Kubernetes Cluster"
  })

  tracing = provider::fc::observability_caas_tracing({
    id                 = "cluster-tracing"
    display_name       = "Distributed Tracing"
    container_platform = local.k8s
  })
}
```

## Signature

```text
observability_caas_tracing(config object) object
```
