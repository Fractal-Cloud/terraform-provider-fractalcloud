# function: bigdata_paas_ml_experiment

Creates an ML Experiment tracking component (e.g. MLflow). If `platform` is provided, it is validated to ensure it is a Distributed Data Processing component and added as a dependency. This ensures the experiment is not reconciled until the platform is active.

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  databricks = provider::fc::bigdata_paas_distributed_data_processing({
    id           = "analytics-platform"
    display_name = "Analytics Platform"
  })

  experiment = provider::fc::bigdata_paas_ml_experiment({
    id              = "model-training"
    display_name    = "Model Training Experiment"
    platform        = local.databricks
    experiment_name = "/Shared/experiments/churn-prediction"
  })
}
```

## Signature

```text
bigdata_paas_ml_experiment(config object) object
```
